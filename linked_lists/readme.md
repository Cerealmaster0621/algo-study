# Linked Lists

## Dummy Pointer

## Fast and Slow Pointers

## What to return?

return head Node in Linked list, that will show entire Linked lists. however, if head is directly modified, save first node with variable (dummy) and return dummy.

## Conventional LL techniques

**making single-linked list to point each other**
curr->next->next = curr (break the connection to the rest of the linked list. save the curr->next->next to variable before for connecting later)
